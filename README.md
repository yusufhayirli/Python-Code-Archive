# Python Code Archive 🐍

> A structured archive of beginner-to-intermediate Python code snippets, exercises, and function-based utilities — noted weekly during my early programming education.

This repository is ideal for those **starting their journey with Python** and looking to understand foundational topics through practical examples and clean explanations.

## 📚 What's Inside?

Organized by topic, this archive includes:

### ✅ Basic Concepts
- Input/output operations
- Conditional statements (`if/else`)
- Type handling and error management
- Math operations (absolute values, square areas, GPA logic, etc.)

### 🔁 Loops & Iterations
- `for` and `while` loop usage patterns
- List traversals and cumulative operations
- Fibonacci series, factorials, and powers via loop

### 📂 File Operations
- Reading and writing from `.txt` files
- Logging employee data
- Matrix parsing and summing via external files

### 📦 Functions & Parameters
- With/without return types and arguments
- Reusability through `main()` calls
- Real-world examples: area, volume, GPA checks

### 🔣 Strings, Lists, Sets & Dictionaries
- Word and digit processing
- Unique value filtering
- Intersection & union logic
- Dictionary structure updates and transformations

### 🔁 Recursion
- Recursive factorial, harmonic, and sum calculators
- Reversing lists, symbol counters, nested list summing
- Pascal’s Triangle (last line & full triangle via recursion)
